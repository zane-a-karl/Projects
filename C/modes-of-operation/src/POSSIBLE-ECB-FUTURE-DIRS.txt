/** POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS TO TAKE THIS CODE
 *
 *  - FRIST AND FOREMOST:
      - create easier testing env for str-inputs
        - I'm not so sure I should care about str inputs at all...
	- If anything I might allow for a flag that will specify that we're dealing with str inputs...maybe

      - clean up str input code (e.g. rename functions)
      - clean up file input code (e.g. give it a utils file)
 *  - Maybe do a shared memory key and then socket io message
 * test with ecb?
 *
 *  - Figure out how to deal with formatting cipher text that falls
 *  in the 0 - 31 range because it messes with readability and makes
 *  pretty much all of these encryptions a bit useless :(
 *   - I have figured out what to do I am going to encode text as base64
