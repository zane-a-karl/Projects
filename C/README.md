Personal Style Guidelines:
  - Most functions should return void, if not detail the reason.
  - Any given line is capped at 70 characters, roughly the width of an emacs session split in half.
  - Function input is ordered like so:
    - Outputs come first in alphabetical order by variable TYPE and then by NAME.
    - Inputs come second in alphabetical order by variable TYPE and then by NAME.
